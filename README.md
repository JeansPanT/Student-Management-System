# Student Management System

Student Management System v1.0 by Siddharth Kar

# Description - 
In this Project, we aim to solve the traditional Student management issues. The existing system provides a paper-based solution for keeping student records, but it gives overload to Teachers and Administrators. The main issues were inappropriate data keeping, and time wastage in storage. These issues are solved by providing separate student data, Keeping each studentâ€™s data separate and easy to access and update in a single click.

This project uses MYSQL as the backend and is developed in Java so it provides features such as platform independence, high performance, and security. It is a desktop application that uses Java Swing and JDBC connectivity frameworks.

It provides some enhanced features such as: an easy interface to add, remove, and update students as well as view students in a Graphical interface table.
